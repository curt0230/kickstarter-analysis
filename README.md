# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Kickstarter is a platform on which project creators can crowdsource funding.  This project analyzes a sample Kickstarter data collected between 2009 and 2017 in order to identify trends for campaigns funding theater projects and plays.

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to determine how successful various campaigns were relative to their launch dates and funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges
Several metrics were derived from original Kickstarter campaign data.  Several dates needed to be converted from Unix timestamps and the parent and subcategory needed to be parsed in order to perform a more detailed analysis.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
